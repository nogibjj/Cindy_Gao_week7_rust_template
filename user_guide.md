   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Move into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Build the project:

#### **4. CI/CD Pipeline**

The project has an automated CI/CD pipeline that:
- Builds the tool
- Runs tests
- Provides the binary as an artifact

The pipeline runs automatically when you push code to the main branch.

---

#### **5. README.md**

Make sure your `README.md` includes:
- How to install the tool
- Basic usage instructions
- Contribution guidelines

### **Deliverables**
- **Packaged Tool**: The binary file will be in `target/release/`.
- **CI/CD**: A pipeline automatically tests and builds your project.
